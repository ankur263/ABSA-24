judg from previou post thi use to be a good place but not ani longer
we there were four of us arriv at noon the place wa empti and the staff act like we were impos on them and they were veri rude
they never brought us complimentari noodl ignor repeat request for sugar and threw our dish on the tabl
the food wa lousi too sweet or too salti and the portion tini
after all that they complain to me about the small tip
avoid thi place
i have eaten at saul mani time the food is alway consist outrag good
saul is the best restaur on smith street and in brooklyn
the duck confit is alway amaz and the foie gra terrin with fig wa out of thi world
the wine list is interest and ha mani good valu
for the price you cannot eat thi well in manhattan
i wa veri disappoint with thi restaur
ive ask a cart attend for a lotu leaf wrap rice and she repli back rice and just walk away
i had to ask her three time befor she final came back with the dish ive request
food wa okay noth great
chow fun wa dri pork shu mai wa more than usual greasi and had to share a tabl with loud and rude famili
i we will never go back to thi place again
went on a 3 day oyster bing with fish bring up the close and i am so glad thi wa the place it o trip end becaus it wa so great
servic wa devin oyster where a sensual as they come and the price can t be beat
you can t go wrong here
everi time in new york i make it a point to visit restaur saul on smith street
everyth is alway cook to perfect the servic is excel the decor cool and underst
i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it wa incred
can t wait wait for my next visit
i had my eye on thi place promis myself i will one day give it a tri
and i hate to say thi but i doubt i ll ever go back
the food is veri averag the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet everi thing they serv is too sweet here
the onli thing i moder enjoy wa their grill chicken special with edamam pure
i had never had edamam pure befor but i thought it wa innov and tasti could ve use a bit more salt
anyway if you re in the neighborhood to eat good food i wouldn t wast my time tri to find someth rather go across the street to tamari
the decor is night tho but they realli need to clean that vent in the ceil it quit un appet and kill your effort to make thi place look sleek and modern
we ate outsid at haru s sake bar becaus haru s restaur next door wa overflow
what s the differ between the two
their sake list wa extens but we were look for purpl haze which wasn t list but made for us upon request
the spici tuna roll wa unusu good and the rock shrimp tempura wa awesom great appet to share
we went around 9 30 on a friday and it had die down a bit by then so the servic wa great
we love th pink poni
the perfect spot
food awesom
servic friendli and attent
ambianc relax and stylish
don t judg thi place prima faci you have to tri it to believ it a home away from home for the liter heart
i have eaten here a hand of time for no reason besid sheer conveni
i hang out and live in the neighborhood
the food is decent
howev it s the servic that leav a bad tast in my mouth
i happen to have a polici that goe along with a littl bit of self respect which includ not let a waiter intimid me i e make me feel bad ask for trivial like water or the check
i know you were too busi show off your vintag tee shirt and look bore but my agenda is i m here to eat and enjoy the compani of friend seek a pleasant experi
well i didn t find it there and trust i have told everyon i can think of about my experi
the last time i walk by it look pretti empti hmmm
thi place ha got to be the best japanes restaur in the new york area
i had a great experi
food is great
servic is top notch
i have been go back again and again
i tend to judg a sushi restaur by it sea urchin which wa heavenli at sushi rose
it melt in my littl mouth and the perfect consist not too fishi creami and slightli butteri
the sushi seem pretti fresh and wa adequ proport
the rice to fish ration wa also good they didn t tri to overpack the rice
we took advanatag of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it wa well worth it
i went to thi restaur with a woman that i met recent
she live nearbi but had never gone to thi establish think that it might be too touristi
surprisingli noth could be further from the truth
in the even thi place attract a well dress with it ny crowd
the food wa well prepar and the servic impec
i m go back
have hunt around for a quiet romant yet not hideous expens restaur i stumbl across review for la lanterna and gave it a shot
quit simpli it s like step out of manhattan and into a haven of tranquil
the servic wa attent yet unimpos the food wa far better than mani notori restaur in midtown and the wine list is extens and well price
the prix fix menu is worth everi penni and you get more than enough both in quantiti and qualiti
i will be go back and heartili recommend it
i ve had the lunch buffet at chennai a coupl of time when i have been in the neighborhood
it is terrif as is the valu
6 and there is much tasti food all of it fresh and continu refil
i am not a vegetarian but almost all the dish were great
frankli when you compar what you can have here for lunch versu mcd or so mani other sandwich shop in the citi there is no comparison
go hungri and enjoy
the food here is rather good but onli if you like to wait for it
i like the somosa chai and the chole but the dhosa and dhal were kinda dissapoint
the servic vari from day to day sometim they re veri nice and sometim not
the kitchen howev is almost alway slow
also specifi if you like your food spici it rather bland if you don t
the ambienc is pretti and nice for convers so a casual lunch here would probabl be best
just went here for my girlfriend 23rd bday
if you ve ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart hous ha to offer
add to that great servic and great food at a reason price and you have yourself the begin of a great even
the lava cake dessert wa incred and i recommend it
onc you step into cosett you re miracul in a small off the beaten path parisian bistro
thi tini restaur is as cozi as it get with that certain parisian flair
the food wa averag to abov averag the french onion soup fill yet not overli impress and the dessert not brilliant in ani way
howev go for the ambienc and consid the food just a companion for a trip across the world
i have never eaten in the restaur howev upon read the review i got take out last week
it wa horribl
the pizza wa deliv cold and the chees wasn t even fulli melt
it look like shred chees partli done still in strip
i have eaten at mani pizza place around nyc and thi is hand down the worst
thi ha got to be one of the most overr restaur in brooklyn
the pizza is overpr and soggi
ye they use fanci ingredi but even fanci ingredi don t make for good pizza unless someon know how to get the crust right
a big disappoint all around
i think i ve had some the best meal of my life at minnow
the seafood is amaz there s a good wine list and the ever chang menu alway offer some great surpris
the combin of super fresh ingredi in the dish are unusu but realli delici
worth the trip from manhattan
wa there friday night
best pastrami i ever had and great portion without be ridicul
and i ve been to mani nyc deli
my wife had the fri shrimp which are huge and love it
price no more than a jersey deli but way better
as a japanes nativ i ve live in the tristat area for over 8 year but i wa just so amaz at thi place
thi place is the most japanes it can ever get
the sign the special menu food and even all the waitstaff are all total japanes
thi place is worth an one hour drive
i am so come back here again as much as i can
leon is an east villag gem casual but hip with well prepar basic french bistro fare good special a warm and live atmospher
my wife and i alway enjoy the young not alway well train but nevertheless friendli staff all of whom have a stori
sit outsid in the warm weather insid for cozi winter
decent wine at reason price
have been dozen of time and never fail to enjoy the experi
our teenag kid love it too
everytim i decid to tri anoth place on the ue i get angri that i didn t just go to zucchero pomodori
thi is by far my favorit place in the neighborhood
the servic is excel the decor is great and the food is delici and come in larg portion
you ll pay at least doubl at ani other italian restaur in the citi and most still don t compar
i m partial to the gnocchi
thi place is incred tini
they refus to seat parti of 3 or more on weekend
the hostess is rude to the point of be offens
the food wa bland oili
i just don t understand all the hype
we went to ino for valentin
we have been to thi place mani time and alway have great food wine and servic
we were worri we would have troubl get in but somehow manag to have a short wait
as alway we had a great glass of wine while we wait
when we sat we got great and fast servic
the peopl that work there are alway so friendli you forget you are in new york sometim
make sure you tri thi place as often as you can
thi is a fun restaur to go to
the pizza is yummi and i like the atmoshper
but the pizza is way to expens
a larg is 20 and top are about 3 each
i went there for lunch and it wa not as good as i expect from the review i read
sauc wa wateri and the food didn t have much flavor
if you like the food and the valu you get from some of chinatown restaur thi is not the place for you
i don t think i would go again
thi place is great
i had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of
the waitress wa veri patient with us and the food is phenomen
servic wa prompt friendli and great
slightli on the pricey side but worth it
great pizza and fantast servic
there wa a small wait but shorter than i expect
locat at the end of a magnific block
veri cozi and warm insid
i will be back
thi is the best sushi in new york citi hand down
the place is small and cramp but the food is fantast
get the tuna of gari
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side
planet thailand ha alway been a hit with me i go there usual for the sushi which is great the thai food is excel too
with the great varieti on the menu i eat here often and never get bore
the atmospher isn t the greatest but i suppos that s how they keep the price down
it s all about the food
i went there with my friend last saturday
first it took us a long time to find the place
we were tire and cold when we got to the restaur then we sat down to begin order appet
but when we look at the menu there weren t a lot of choic most of them were dumpl in the appet section
then we order a dinosaur roll and white tuna sashimi
those roll were big but not good and sashimi wasn t fresh
they were dri and disgust i didn t even finish my first piec
hurley s is like cheer where everyon know your name and they are actual glad you came
tri the crunchi tuna it is to die for
tri everyth for that matter it is all good
i have been go there sinc it open and i can t get enough
first went here to enjoy their garden terrac
the food wa amaz and the servic wa prompt and help but not over bear or rush
the steak tartar is a great bet they fix it for you at the tabl
admittedli some night insid the restaur were rather warm but the open kitchen is part of the charm
great wine select gigonda is worth the price and the hous champagn is a great valu
it may be a bit pack on weekend but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area
have recommend the place to friend alway get good respons
pizza the onli pizza in nyc that should not have addit top the crust tast like the best freshli bake bread
veal parmigana better than patsi s
much more reason price too
i take all my nyc guest to vt s
not sure where the previou review lonk dine but saul is in a great neighborhood and ha great food
i ve been there three time and have alway had wonder experi
i d highli recommend it for a special occas it provid and intim set and nice servic

step on my foot on the second time he reach over me to adjust light
tini dessert wa 8 00 just plain overpr for what it is
the drink are alway welll made and wine select is fairli price
tri their chef s special they are to die for
servic is not exactli five star but that not realli a big deal
downstair loung is alway a good attract
raga s is a romant cozi restaur
the exot food is beauti present and is a delight in delici combin
it is also extrem well price
the staff is incred help and attent
the bar is veri well stock with interest beer and well price wine
thi is one of my favorit restaur and it is not to be miss
your friend will thank you for introduc them to thi gem
when we stumbl on leon we thought that we had found quit the gem but we were certainli wrong
the waitress move our tabl practic into the bathroom and when we ask to cancel our dinner order becaus we did not want to eat sit on the toilet we were told no
then to top thing off she drop use silverwar on my boyfriend s jacket and did not stop to apolog or clean the mess that wa left on cloth
such a disappoint
rude servic medicor food there are ton of restaur in ny stay away from thi one
i had a grat time at jekyl and hyde
i love everythig about it especi the show and actor
our server wa veri help and friendli
i am bring my whole famili back next time
the food wa good too
the tuna and wasab potato are excel
the outdoor atmospher of sit on the sidewalk watch the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenu on a cool even wa wonder
insid is a littl cramp but to be expect
servic wa prompt and courteou
thi wa a repeat visit and we ll definit be back again
great servic great food
price are in line
compar to other shabu restaur around town thi place win hand down
but too far east
i live a block away and go to patsi s frequent
the pizza is delici they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap frozen shred chees common to most pizzaria s
two complaint their appet select stink it would be nice to get some mozzarella stick on the menu
also becaus it is so thin it get cold veri quickli and it not that fill
so eat fast and order a lot
wait staff is blantent unappreci of your busi but it the best pie on the uw
by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaur
fine dine restaur qualiti
over 100 differ choic to creat your own

on a recent sunday afternoon a friend and i accid found thi great restaur on our way to see the pulitz prize win play doubt

we will return mani time for thi oasi in mid town
i grew up on these bagel

the sake menu should not be overlook
all in all thi midtown gem instantli becam one of my favorit sushi restaur in the citi
tri the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll
we visit orsay dure ny restaur week and tri their 35 menu
servic wa veri good prompt attent and non intrus
food wa veri good as well consid that we tri the budget select though i wish the pork belli that i order wa roast a bit longer so that fat wa more of a melt in your mouth experi
wine list select is good and wine by the glass wa gener fill to the top
tradit french decour wa pleasant though the hall wa rather noisi the restaur wa full and we had to rais our voic to be abl to maintain a convers
i ve been to at cafe spice probabl 5 8 time it is probabl still the best indian restaur around union squar
to sum it up servic vari from good to mediorc depend on which waiter you get gener it is just averag ok
seat is alway prompt though the restaur doe fill up in the even
food is usual veri good though ocasion i wonder about freshmess of raw vegat in side order
as mani other review notic your order is often slow to arriv thi is particularli true in the even but is not a problem dure lunch time
the decor is vibrant and eye pleas with sever semi privat both on the right side of the dine hall which are great for a date
i have never been disappoint in the red eye
the first time i went and wa complet taken by the live jazz band and atmospher i order the lobster cobb salad
i ve never order anyth els from their menu there s no need to
it s simpli the best meal in nyc
you cannot go wrong at the red eye grill
if we were to move from the upper east side we would genuin miss thi restaur
we ve live in the area for more than 8 year
the restaur is cute but not upscal
the food is a diamond in rough the food is delici and homemad with the perfect balanc of herb and tomato

other guest enjoy pizza santa fe chop salad and fish and chip
i highli recommend cafe st bart s for their food the ambienc and wonder servic
all the staff is absolut profession
i sometim see the waiter don t have enough knowledg of their dish
but they do
that is a must but not everi restaur can do
if you want to dine with larg parti i recommend to make reserv basement
there s nice and quiet small but enough for 6 or more
thi restaur wa way overhyp
my chow fun and chow see wa realli bland and oili
okay i don t mind the oili part caus most are cook that way but it wa way too bland
the scallion pancak and fri dumpl were noth out of the ordinari
the servic wa the onli thing good about thi restaur
it s bore on the insid and our sushi wa pretti below averag the tuna wa soggi and the other roll had no flavor
i definit wouldn t go back
there are mani thai place in the citi but so far toon is 1
their pad penang is delici and everyth els is fantast

hat off to the chef
i am not the most experienc person when it come to thai food but my friend who took me there is

on a hot day it wa fabul to stop in and enjoy lunch
ambienc is so cute and quaint good for busi although we were there on vacat
salad were fantast
although we were look for regular lettuc and some walnut the salad we got were great
ingredi are organ which is a real plu for me
we will be back
thi is some realli good inexpens sushi
it cost 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an insid out roll but the roll more than tripl in size and that s not just from the rice
the spici tuna roll is huge and probabl the best that i ve had at thi price rang
the yellowtail wa particularli good as well
i have reserv about the all you can eat deal howev the choic are fairli limit and you can probabl order more food than you can eat for less than 18 by just go off the menu
in ani event thi is a place i ll be sure to stop by again when i m in thi part of town
big wong get big up for a fine establish
they have it all great price food and servic
the atmospher is noisi and the waiter are liter walk around do thing as fast as they can
the food is prepar quickli and effici
and it all come at a veri reason price conge noodl and rice dish are no more than 3 6 each
the takeout is great too sinc they give high qualiti tupperwar as well
thi place is alway veri crowd and popular
went here on a friend s reccomend

the staff wa accomod the food wa absolut delici and the place is love
we even had a visit from the manag who want to make sure we were enjoy ourselv

we all felt it wa worth it
sometim i get good food and ok servic
sometim i get bad food and bad servic sometim i get good good and bad servic
it is not consist
realli depend on your luck
the place is a bistro which mean simpl dish and wine serv effici in a bustl atmospher
and where doe pati go wrong no where
you are not eat haut cuisin with subtl hint of whatev but cassuolet steak fritt tripe stew etc simpl stuff
and evalu on those term pasti is simpli wonder
right off the l in brooklyn thi is a nice cozi place with good pizza
mine wa a littl burnt but still delici with goat chees and panchetta raddichio wa kind of bitter though
my friend got the mushroom pizza which tast better
the sangria wa pretti tasti and good on a hot muggi day
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busi might be abl to fit a group or kid
overal i would recommend it and go back again
come from boston thi place is like emma s pizza in kendal squar in cambridg although they have more funki top
i start out with a bombay beer which wa big enough for two
for dinner i had the chicken tikka masala and some garlic naan

it s a nice place to relax and have convers
i can t wait to go back
we have live in chelsea for two year and have never notic thi restaur
the food is authent italian delici
pizza is terrif as is homemad pasta
ambienc is delight servic impecc
i m still mad that i had to pay for lousi food
the hanger steak wa like rubber and the tuna wa flavorless not to mention it tast like it had just been thaw
servic wa also horribl and the ambienc is not that great
do not tri unless you re just go there to hang out like the rest of the hipster who appar have no sens of tast
i go and eat out at mani differ restaur and thi is one place you have go and tri
thi is my first time write a review for a restaur becaus the food and servic wa excel
the filet mignon dish wa superb
i would defiantli come back here again as one of my top choic

i absolut love thi place
from the street it look veri hidden and is actual an old warehous
i like the ambienc it s veri dark and origin
i came here for my friend s birthday and keep come back ever sinc

veri afford and excel ambient
we order some beef and noodl soup dish from the thai section of the menu but noth we got wa thai

howev i think thi place is a good hang out spot
next time we wouldn t dare order anyth els other than some simpl asian appet and drink
my girlfriend and i stumbl onto thi hop place the other night and had a great time
the pizza and wine were excel the servic too but what realli made thi place wa the backyard dine area
it is one the nicest outdoor restaur i have ever seen in ny i am from itali and thi place rival the one in my countri
they tell me they are go to cover the garden in glass for the winter so i m look forward to go there on a snowi night to enjoy it
check thi place out
highli recommend
first of all thi place is not romant as claim by citysearch s editori review
either that or the editor s idea of romanc must be share a convers with the next tabl while tri to speak louder than the traffic on 57th
the tabl are cram way too close the menu is typic of ani italian restaur and the wine list is simpli overpr
slightli abov averag wine start at 70 with onli one select list at 30
servic is not what one would expect from a joint in thi price categori
for instanc plate were just dump on the tabl i wa hand the wine list upsid down etc
somehow work the italian charm with constant mill grazi doe not constitut proper servic
to be complet fair the onli redeem factor wa the food which wa abov averag but couldn t make up for all the other defici of teodora
to celebr a birthday three of us went to mare anticip great food
not one of our meal wa edibl bland and or made with weird rosemari or orang flavor
fish wa overdon
cute place nice wait staff but would never go there again
someon els recommend the dessert we also left that
one of us actual like the expresso that s it
skip thi restaur it s a big disappoint
myagi is one of my favorit restaur in the citi the place the neg review describ sound like they were somewher els
i ve never had bad servic and the fish is fresh and delici
their tuna tartar appet is to die for
i come from a famili of pizzeria owner and i m almost asham to say that the pizza in fornino s blow my famili receipi away

i highli recommend to anyon to give thi place a tri
you will find yourself return quit often
p s pleas don t tell anyon in my famili i eat there
lol
a restaur that doesn t tri to do anyth except serv great food with great servic in a pleasant atmospher
no gimmick here the food speak for itself in it fresh and prepar
the dine room is quietli eleg with no music to shout over how refresh
the servic wa impecc and unobtrus the staff know what they are there to do to know their menu present your meal and attend to your need
look around i saw a room full of new yorker enjoy a real meal in a real restaur not a clubhous of the fabul tri to be seen
beauti experi
the view is breathtak the servic is top notch the ambianc is wonderful
the staff offer impecc servic
i had lobster bisqu it ha 2 oz of main lobster in it

my boyfriend had prime rib it wa good
we didn t want a bottl of bubbl on a weekday so we each got littl bottl of korbett it wa just enough
we had lava cake we order when our food came it take at least a 1 2 to make it

if you like spici food get the chicken vindaloo
it s veri spici but not offens

the portion are larg and the server alway surpris us with a differ starter
the wine list is excel
the food is amaz especi if you get the chef s tast menu and your favourit bottl or two of wine from an extens select of wine
the place is small and intim and you may feel a littl crowd but the servic is excel and it s great for friend out a romant date or a special occass
peopl dress in suit or even gown as well as shirt jean
the food can get pricey but the prix fix tast menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to ani food allergi or food you don t like
recommend of cours are requir
pleas be awar that it s cash or amex onli
with the except of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eye start water the food here wa decent not great
the menu is veri limit i think we count 4 or 5 entre
we order the special grill branzino that wa so infus with bone it wa difficult to eat
the decor in thi place is veri diner ish and the kind of place you expect in the east villag not romant just simpl small and spars
problem is noth at prune is particularli memor
no plan to return anytim soon
thi place is so much fun
our famili never expect such incred entertain in a restaur
thi place must have cost the owner afortun to build
i think the stuff wa better than disney
our food wa great too
and realli larg portion
the staff wa the friendliest that have seen in new york
we will go back everi time we are in the citi
if you want someth realli differ than tri jekyl and hyde

i am go to the mid town locat next
the place is a lot of fun
my six year old love it
the charact realli make for an enjoy experi

grow up in ny i have eaten my share of bagel

the bagel alway warm soft on the insid crispi on the outsid and enorm in size
they have a huge select of differ cream chees and all of their salad are great
the lox is alway fresh too
highli recommend to all
i have to agre with the previou review

price too high for thi cramp and unapp restur
zero ambianc to boot
i thought thi place wa total overr
everyth we had wa good or ok but definit noth great
the ambienc wa nice but servic wasn t so great
when you add it all togeth it just doesn t seem worth it to me especi consid the price
thi is the best shabu shabu restaur in the tri state area
i have live in japan for 7 year and the tast of the food and the feel of the restaur is like be back in japan
thiu is a must for anyon who love shabu shabu
the atmospher is noth special but it feel like a sushi establish in tokyo
the owner and staff are all japanes as well and that add to the entir ambianc
despit a slightli limit menu everyth prepar is done to perfect ultra fresh and a work of food art
i must give it yon out of yon star
taxan delici
arigato gozima yuka
thi restaur wa recommend by a local as a matter of fact he made the reserv for us and said we would not be disappoint

there is a lot of varieti even for peopl who eat vegetarian like me
tri green curri with veget
the quantiti is also veri good you will come out satisfi
the servic is ok some of the peopl didn t get what they ask for
i wa there on sat for my birthday and we had an excel time

molto bene
thi quaint and romant trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaur list
the food is delici from the special to the regular menu fare the dish are never a disappoint
whether it s the parmesean porcini souffl or the lamb glaze with balsam vinegar you will sure be transport to northern itali with one bite
although the tabl may be close situat the candl light food qualiti and servic overcompens
a guarantee delight
i have known about thi secret for the last 13 year emilio the godfath ha continu to serv food and wine for the god at mortal price

the food is good i can t lie
but the staff wa so horribl to us
the hostess and the waitress were incred rude and did everyth they could to rush us out
we were plan to get dessert but the waitress basic through the bill at us befor we had a chanc to order
thi place is pricey and ye the food is worth it but the servic make you feel like you should be pay a quater of the price
save yourself the time and troubl and skip thi one
i ll keep thi short
amma is noth special
the two star chef left quit some time ago to open their own place
i ate here a week ago and found most dish averag at best and too expens
will not be back

decor is nice though servic can be spotti
thi place is alway pack
i know becaus i live nearbi
most importantli food is excel
tri the sea bass

first of all dal bukhara rock
as a student in nyu i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usual i just go to ani indian restraunt near by
but ive heard a lot about thi for the past 2 yr and final decid to eat here
i am happi i did the food wa awsom

they are open two more place as i saw a flyer there one in yonker which is a restraunt and banquet hall and anoth one in parsipanni new jersey
but overal i give it a 10
10
i haven t been to the other locat
haru on park s is simpli disgust
the fish wa not fresh and the rice tast old and stale
quit frankli thi is some of the worst sushi i have ever tri
will never be back
honestli the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entir live
believ us we ve been eat sushi for over 15 yr
not sure whi thi restaur would be rate that highli
the all u can eat sushi is definit in veri poor qualiti
limit menu no so fresh ingredi thinli slice fish fall apart rice
the onli thing u could realli tast are the veri salti soy sauc even it low sodium the vinegar soak rice and the scallion on top of the fish
the waitstaff are nice though
wont come back again for sure
i have been to roth s twice and both time were veri disappoint
onc for dinner and onc for brunch
both time i wa extrem dissappoint by the servic which wa boarderlin rude
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine befor offer anoth
much of the time it seem like they do not care about you
the dinner wa ok noth i would have again
i had their egg benedict for brunch which were the worst in my entir life i tri remov the hollondais sauc complet that wa how fail it wa
thi wa a great surpris
with the theater 2 block away we had a delici meal in a beauti room
the servic wa attent
i look forward to eat here again
planet thai is great
we love the food drink and atmospher
the svc can be a bit rude at time esp if you have big group but overal the restaur is a must
tri the pad thai it s fabul and their price are so cheap
just becaus it s cheap doe not mean the portion are small or the food is nasti it is great
just rememb the later you go the longer you may have to wait
it s popular w the late crowd
they forgot a sandwich didn t includ plastic fork and didn t includ pita with the hummu platter
also the sandwich near 7 didn t come with anyth like chip or a side
overal not worth the money
eat in the atmospher save it but at your desk it s a veri disappoint experi
i love indian food and consid myself to be quit an expert on it
chennai garden is my favorit indian restaur in the citi
they have authent indian at amazin price
thi restaur is vegetarian there are no meat dish whatsoev
the seat are uncomfort if you are sit against the wall on wooden bench
it s a rather cramp and busi restaur and it close earli
patroon featur a nice cigar bar and ha great staff
the food is tasti and portion size are appropri
thi is a nice restaur if you are look for a good place to host an intim dinner meet with busi associ
not a great place for famili or gener dine
lloovv thi place
food is excel
fish is so veri fresh
waitstaff are veri friendli
love yuka
mermaid inn is an overal good restaur with realli good seafood
the menu is limit but almost all of the dish are excel
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallop and shrimp is great
the servic is good and ambienc is good for a date or group outing
the onli fallback on thi restaur is the price
even though it good seafood the price are too high
the lobster sandwich is 24 and although it wa good it wa not nearli enough to warrant that price
went to villag last night for my birthday
we pick it randomli without a recommend from someon who ha been there so we weren t sure what to expect
we were veri pleasantli surpris
the food wa delici i had a halibut special my husband had steak and the servic wa top notch
when my dessert came there wa a candl in it not becaus anyon ask for one but becaus the waiter must have seen me open my birthday card and gift and said he knew it wa a special occass of some sort
truli the mark of an attent waiter
i highli recommend the restaur base on our experi last night
we ate at thi thai place follow the review but veri unhappi with the food
we thought that thi place is use too much of msg cook in the food
whi
they don t concern much of custom s health just want to make money
pleas don t fool us
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke
i recommend the jelli fish drunken chicken and the soupi dumpl certainli the stir fri blue crab
the food is so cheap and the waiter are nice
of cours it is crowd but who care
authent shanghai style and i cannot recommend a better shanghai place in new york
have frequent ino for sever year and the food remain excel
chees plate is a vari delight and great bargain at 10
the larg select of bruschetta panini tramezzini keep the palat from stagnat
the asparagu truffl oil parmesan bruschetta is a winner
wine list is extens without be over price
be sure to tri the season and alway delici special
definit a neighborhood favorit
i love thi place
i almost hesitit to write a review becaus the atmospher wa so great and i would hate for it too becom to crowd
the food wa veri good a great deal and the place it self wa great
the wait staff is veri freindli they make it feel like you re eat in a freindli littl european town
i like cafe noir dont get me wrong it is jsut that the peopl who work there are evil and incompet
the servic wa terribl we had to wait for everyth and ask sever of differ peopl for the same thing befor we were allow to be serv
the waitress seem to be more concern of look good than actual waitress
after dinner the manag grab my boyfriend ask him where are you from mayb you dont know how thing work in america and in the end storm away almost tearey yell that tip are the onli thing they surviv on
we did tip i guess the model waitress just want more and complain to the manag
the whole set up is truli unprofession and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff becaus despit the current one thi is a great place
pizza here is consist good
salad are a delici way to begin the meal
you should pass on the calamari
it is thick and slightli soggi
decor is charm
servic is averag
what a great place
i came into the citi to tri out thi restaur becaus a friend had recommend it to my husband
the ambienc wa so fun and the price were great on top of the fact that the food wa realli tasti
i wasn t thrill to have to wait on line for thirti minut but i guess that s the price you pay for a popular place
i would definit recommend sea if you like thai cuisin
i wa here a few week back and we had the worst custom servic experi at a restaur ever
a gentleman mayb the manag came to our tabl and without so much as a smile or greet ask for our order
when ask about how a certain dish wa prepar in comparison to a similar at other thai restaur he repli thi is not mcdonald s everi place make thing differ
while it is understand that everi place is inde differ there wa not a need to be uncourt to custom and downright rude
the servic wa poor restaur poorli lit staff not veri attent and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald s than thi joint
never again
i absolut love thi place

i got an excel piec of cheesecak and we had sever other nice pastri
i would recommend roxi s for that but not for their food
my son and hi girlfriend both want cheeseburg and they were huge
but they were too big for the bun
consequ their burger fell apart in their hand and made such a mess that they did nt feel like finish them
also they were 15 each
i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll
it wa 14 not realli bad for a pound of pastrami but it didn t have much tast i ve had better for less elsewher
thi place is realli trendi but they have forgotten about the most import part of a restaur the food
the last two time i order from here my food wa soo spici that i could bare eat it and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish
and the tom kha soup wa pathet
if you want good authent thai thi place is not the place to go
we went here for lunch a coupl of week ago on a saturday and i wa thoroughli impress with the food
the pesto pizza wa excel thin crust pizza with a nice amount of spici italian chees that i d never heard of befor

i will definetli be go back

for the peopl who want great food plu great servic roxi is a place to avoid
i ve been here twice now
the first time the sushi wa outstand the second time it wa a littl bland
i m sure i ll return for a final judgement tho
the blond wood decor is veri sooth the premium sake is excel and the servic is great
mizu is the japenes find in grammerci
while their kitchen food is delici their sushi is out of thi world
mizu is home to creativ and uniqu roll not to found anywher els
not onli is the cuisin the best around the servic ha alway been attent and charm
warn you may find it difficult to dine at other japanes restaur after a visit to mizu
thalia is a beauti restaur with beauti peopl serv you but the food doesn t quit match up
i order the smoke salmon and roe appet and it wa off flavor
the entre wa bland and small dessert wa not inspir
i expect quit a bit more from such an expens menu
the view is spectacular and the food is great
wonder strawberri daiquiri as well
definit worth the trip to batteri park citi
one of my favorit place in manhattan
authent taiwanes food that s cheap what more could you ask for
besid that there should be more restaur like it around the citi
the cold appet dish tast like the way i rememb them to tast when i wa grow up in taiwan

great neighborhood joint
thi is a nice pizza place with good select of thin crust pizza includ the basil slice
their calzon are horrif bad vomit induc yuck
they smell like they stuff them with old can veget like the spinach mushroom calzon
the counter servic is bad
they charg differ price all the time
they re rude at time and not veri friendli
no pizza 33 for me
anybodi who like thi place must be from a differ planet where greasi dri and tasteless are complimentari
the dosa are skimpi unattract and drip with greas and person i d drink popcorn top befor i d eat anoth one of these
the sandwich are dri tasteless and way overpr
call the place hampton chutney co doe warn you that these folk offer more style than substanc but in thi unattract room with unhelp clerk there wa a dearth of the former too
serious thi place kick ass
the atmospher is unherald the servic impec and the food magnific
best italian food i ever had and be italian that mean alot
it is nearli imposs to get a tabl so if you ever have the chanc to go here for dinner do not pass it up
thi is such a love peac place to eat outsid
the restaur look out over beauti green lawn to the hudson river and the statu of liberti
it is set far from the small street it s on and there is no traffic nois
the food is good especi their more basic dish and the drink are delici
thi is a great place to take out of towner and perfect for watch the sunset
great sushi experi
nice valu
uniqu apppet
tri sushimi cucumb roll
good spread great beverag select and bagel realli tasti
the big complaint no toast avail
i complet the total bagel experi by have it lightli toast
murray won t do it
won t or can t is not in the servic directori
but who say murray s is anyth about servic
so close but not good enough
don t be fool by crowd of peopl
the servic is aw
thi place is not worth the price
also don t plan on ask for your favorit roll if it s not on the menu you can t have it
love pizza 33
i will be out with friend and all of a sudden i am hungri and i onli crave one thing their pizza
i live in the neightborhood and am a regular
it hit the spot everi time
thi tini williamsburg spot is alway pleasantli surpris
the pizza is delici and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc
even the pasta is delici here a rariti in new york pizza restaur
i ve been mani time and have never been disappoint
compar to ess a tal offer a less doughi bagel
they even scoop it out nice for those on a diet not too much not to littl
the cream chees are out of thi world and i love that coffe
a littl crowd but they move that line realli fast
a littl pricey but it realli hit the spot on a sunday morn
bagel are ok but be sure not to make ani special request
i ask for an open face chees sandwich and the manag basic told me to take my busi elsewher
be sure not to get anyth other than bagel
the turkey burger are scari
the worst excus for japanes food i ve ever encount
the soup for the udon wa soy sauc and water
the sushi wa aw
the rice wa poor qualiti and wa cook so badli it wa hard
furthermor the rice had no season so the sushi wa bland and disgust
the fish wa adequ but inexpertli slice
it is obviou that no one in the restaur ha ani idea about or experi with japanes cuisin
good fast servic
i would highli recommend
food is great and inexpens
the locat is perfect
give it a tri and enjoy
i thought go to jimmi would give me a real domincan exprienc
jimmi is dominican
well thi place is so ghetto it not even funni
if you like your music blast and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottl minimun then you ll love it here
would never go back there
too bad latin quarter close
that place wa awesom salli
awsom pizza especi the margheritta slice
alway busi but fast move
great atmosher and worth everi bit
open late well as late as i ever got there and i m a night person
winni and her staff are the best crew you can find serv you
the food is reliabl and the price is moder
what more can you ask for
for authent thai food look no further than toon
ive been to mani thai restaur in manhattan befor and toon is by far the best thai food ive had except for my mom s of cours
tri the pad thai or sampl anyth on the appet menu they re all delici
everyth about thi restaur wa special
the servic wa attent yet discreet
the flavor robust and subtl
the brioch and lolli as parti favor is a cute and sweet touch to a most memor meal
i m save up for my next visit
i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and reflesh with my date
the place wa quiet and delight
servic wa good and food is wonder
i did not tri the caviar but i tri their salmon and crab salad they are all good
it is definit a good spot for snack and chat
as a retir hipster i can say with some degre of certainti that for the last year lucki strike ha been the best laid back late night in the citi
the wait staff is pleasant fun and for the most part gorgeou in the wonder aesthet beautif way not in that she s way cuter than me that b way
the food is yummi especi their cook to perfect mussel in spici tomato sauc and their shoestr crispi fri
but the best part about ls is the late night atmospher delight free of the bt
you can get a complet delish martini in a glass that s about 2 1 2 drink for 8 50 i recommend the vanilla shanti mmmm in a great homey set with great music
the in hous ladi dj on saturday night ha outrag good tast in music and moreov take request
you can t go wrong with thi place
suan is a great place that i often take my friend classmat too
it locat is good and the fact that hutner colleg is near and their price are veri reason make student go back to suan again and again
i love their thai
noodl with shrimp and chicken and coconut juic is the must
i wa in love with pongsri on 48th but compar to suan it is slow in servic and overpr
i will go back to suan soon
in summer eat outsid on a terrac anoth great featur of suan
i cannot imagin a friendlier staff work in a restaur
i cannot imagin better indian food in all of the citi
i cannot imagin you not rush out to eat there
thi restaur use to be our regular thursday night dinner locat
dure the cours of the past 3 month the chef and staff chang and it wa not for the better
i wish they would chang back to what it wa befor
the food now is inconsist
thi is the kind of place you d like to take all your friend to and still keep a secret
the set is casual and romant
price are veri good
the food is excel
if you re dare tri the balsam vinegar over icecream it s wonder
do not get the go go hamburg no matter what the review say
they were such a rip off 8 95 for four small meat patti in steam bun and not worth tri
the rest of the dim sum though pricey by chinatown standard is worth it
steam fresh so brought hot hot hot to your tabl
the wait here is long for dim sum but if you don t like share tabl or if the typic raucou dim sum atmospher is not your gig thi is a sleek for chinatown altern
a few tip skip the turnip cake roast pork bun and egg custard
these are overpr and you can get better just around the corner
1 turnip cake at the littl kiosk on east side of mott st just south of bayard
2 egg custard and pork bun at either bakeri on west side of mott street just south of canal
after pass by thi restaur for sometim i final decid to go in and have dinner
i wa pleasantli supris
the food wa except
the menu consist of standard brassier food better then place like balthazar etc
i choos to go with one of the special the brais lamb shank in red wine which wa excel
the servic wa friendli and the atmospher wa casual
the restaur is a bit noisi but that is someth that can be overlook onc you sit down and enjoy a great meal
thi littl place ha a cute interior decor and afford citi price
the pad se ew chicken wa delici howev the pad thai wa far too oili
i would just ask for no oil next time
have eaten at ginger hous sever time and it s alway good
the fri dumpl are great
final a reliabl chines restaur
thi place would be so much better serv by be run by a group that actual understand custom servic
the onli thing you can do here is walk in and eat but plan an event especi a small intim one forget about it
they are not help in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date roll around you will not onli regret chose thi place but also becom hostil
nobodi at thi restaur will give firm answer about anyth and in the end not one person take respons for anyth
terribl terribl manag deserv to be shut down
never fail to pleas
delici bagel especi when right out of the oven
spread and top are great though a bit pricey
servic is fast and friendli
onli drawback they won t toast your bagel and they don t make egg for the bagel
but that is highli forgiv
been there done that and new york it s not that big a deal
the food is decent at best and the ambienc well it s a matter of opinion some may consid it to be a sweet thing i thought it wa just annoy
if celebr make you sweat then your in for a ride but if your like most around these part then you ll just yawn and wonder what with all the hype
rao is a good restaur but it s noth special
i ve eaten at mani differ indian restaur
but after last night spice grill is the onli place i m eat indian cuisin
you must tri the shrimp appet
even my indian friend couldn t believ how good and tasti everyth wa
thi place ha the the correct ambienc and an excel staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time
great food great price great servic
if you are look for a good qualiti cheap eat thi is the place
it s a perfect place to have a amanz indian food
i realli love the differ and inov touch that s the cheff give to the food
also it s great to have dinner in a veri romant and confort place the servic it s just perfect they re so frendli that we never want to live the place
i love ess a bagel but i live on the west side so i often go to murray s for conveni
their bagel are fine but they are a littl overcook and not realli a special bagel experi
better than the bagel shop on the corner but not worth go out of your way for in my opinion
also a littl more expens than your averag bagel place
great bagel made the old fashion way
the appet is excel just as good as zabar barney greengrass at a reason price if bought by the pound
drawback servic is slow and they don t toast
the food wa absolut amaz
the bake clam octopu we share as appet were the best we ve ever had
the lamb wa tender so full of flavor the dessert wa divin
the waiter wa attent
the place itself is beauti the bar scene seem to be happen
downtown dinner 2002 prix fix appet were ok waiter gave me poor suggest tri the potato stuff kanish best one
small serv for main entre i had salmon wasnt impress girlfriend had chicken it wa good
dessert is a joke dont bother
volar virgin or weekli regular everyon get treat the same and you can t ask for more than that when the servic is thi friendli
the restaur ha a famili feel not least with regard to the portion which are enorm the veal alon could have singl handedli solv third world famin
the anti pasta wa excel especi the calamari as were the fill pasta main
the wine list is extens and can easili hike up an otherwis reason price meal
still ani quibbl about the bill were off set by the pour your own measur of liquer which were courtesey of the hous
fantast place
cute and decor
a pleasant surpris
go there to relax and feel like your somewher els
lucki strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat

great food great decor great servic

wonder at holiday time
